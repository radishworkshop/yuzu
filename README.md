## About Yuzu üçã

Yuzu is an open-source platform for translation management and localization of codebases.
We are building it publicly for everyone to see and use, which helps us get
more feedback and input. Most users will only use the command line interface,
but you may also self-host the entire application if you prefer.

The hosted version is at [yuzujs.com](https://www.yuzujs.com) and the command-line
interface is at [npmjs.com/yuzu](https://npmjs.com/yuzu).

Yuzu takes an opinionated approach to localization, which saves time and simplifies the
process if you are able to follow the guidelines. The primary default assumption that is not common is that for readability and ease of initial adoption, your message id should simply be your default language string.

## Built with üõ†Ô∏è

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/)
- [Codesheets](https://codesheets.com/)
- [Xata](https://xata.io/)
- [DeepL](https://deepl.com/)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
- [next-international](https://next-international.vercel.app/)
- [OpenStatus](https://openstatus.dev/)

## Command Line Interface üë©‚Äçüíª
The following commands are the core operations of the [yuzu npm package](https://npmjs.com/yuzu). You'll also need to implement an underlying i18n library, such as next-international.

For NextJS, this includes wrapping your strings as messages, adding middleware, and building
a UI for language switcher. Examples of each are available in the [Yuzu docs](https://yuzujs.com/docs).

### Initialization
It's now [recommended](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally) to run `bunx` or `npx` instead of `npm -g`.
```bash
bunx yuzu init # or npx
```
The initializer will ask you a number of questions and create a `yuzu.config.ts` file.
TypeScript is recommended but not required.

This will also guide you through the process of creating a project on [yuzujs.com](https://yuzujs.com).

#### NextJS App Router
For projects using NextJS app router, Yuzu uses [next-international](https://next-international.vercel.app/) out of the box, an up-to-date library for i18n.

There are a few other common commands to manage strings and keep them in sync.

### Build
Locally sync your yuzu directory to t() wrapped strings.
```bash
bunx yuzu build # or npx
```
### Push
Push your messages and locales to your Yuzu project.
```bash
bunx yuzu push # or npx
```

### Translate
Use machine translation to fill in any missing translations in your Yuzu project.
Yuzu also provides you with a [Codesheet](https://codesheets.com) that you can make changes too, ask GPT-4 for
help with, or share with a multilingual friend or vendor for edits.
```bash
bunx yuzu translate # or npx
```

### Pull
Pull down the latest translations from your Yuzu project.
```bash
bunx yuzu pull # or npx
```

## Self-hosting üñ•Ô∏è

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 18.0.0
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) >= 1.0.8

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/radishworkshop/yuzu.git
  ```

2. Install dependencies

  ```sh
  bun i
  ```

3. Get your API keys

  For everything to work out of the box, you will need API keys for
  [Clerk](https://clerk.com) (Auth),
  [Codesheets](https://codesheets.com) (TMS + GPT-4),
  [Xata](https://xata.io) (DB, see `apps/web/db/xata.ts` for schema),
  [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/pro-api) (ML translation),
  and [Google Translate](https://cloud.google.com/translate) (ML translation)

4. Set up your environment 

  In `apps/web` you will find .env.example. Change the name to .env.local and add your own values. You'll also want to update `apps/web/.xatarc` with your database URL.

5. Add your fonts

  [yuzujs.com](https://yuzujs.com) uses a licensed font called Codec Pro, which is not free and therefore included in this repository. In production, Codec Pro is loaded at build time via a script called `scripts/install-fonts.js`. It uses the FONTS_API_KEY environment variable and gets the fonts from a secret URL at my personal website, zackrw.com.

  You can easily get everything working by using `next/font/google` in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx` or making a fonts folder in `apps/web` and importing those. You can also purchase [Codec Pro](https://www.zetafonts.com/codec-pro) yourself if you feel like supporting it, and then copy those files into fonts. Or, you can even make your own server and use `FONTS_API_KEY` like we do.

  If you decide to replace `next/font/local` with `next/font/google` in `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`, here are [more details](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/components/font)). For example:

  ```ts
  // replace 'next/font/local' and delete references to codecPro
  import { Inter } from 'next/font/google' 

  // replace codecPro.className
  <body className={inter.className}> ... </body>
  ```

6. Start the development server

  ```sh
  bun dev
  ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see your server running.
