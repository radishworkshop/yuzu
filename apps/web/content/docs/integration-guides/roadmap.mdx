Yuzu can be used on any JavaScript project, but we want to make it as easy as possible to get started. Next on the list for dedicated support are currently:

* [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

If you would like to see this sooner or contribute directly, please let us know on [discord](/discord) or via [email](mailto:contact@yuzujs.com).
