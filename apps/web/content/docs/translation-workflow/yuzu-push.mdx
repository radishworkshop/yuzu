title: Pushing to Yuzu
description: Your codebase is the source of truth for the messages
---

Now that you've built your messages in your default language file (e.g. en.json), you are ready to push them to your yuzu project, along with the list of supported locales from your
yuzu config file.

```bash
npx yuzu push
```

Now when you go to your Yuzu project, you'll see that the locales and messages are in the Codesheet.

You can can fill in anything you want manually, share the sheet with a multilingual friend, or proceed to `translate` everything in a few seconds.
