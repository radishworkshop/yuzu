title: Pulling down your dictionary
description: The final step to prepare your dictionary
---

Once your Codesheet accurately represents your dictionary, you can pull it down into your project.

```bash
npx yuzu pull
```

This will replace each generated JSON file with the latest translations from your Codesheet.
As mentioned previously, you never want to edit the generated JSON manually. It's error-prone
and could get overwritten with the next `pull`.

That's it. This is the core translation workflow:

* `build` when you change the messages in your codebase wrapped in `t()` calls.
* `push` updated messages to the web backend.
* `translate` any missing strings at your convenience.
* `pull` down the latest dictionary.

Depending you your web framework (e.g. NextJS, Astro, SvelteKit, Nuxt, etc.), you'll have a few more things to do to get things set up and working end-to-end. For example, in NextJS, you'll need a `middleware.ts` file to handle path-based routing and a `<LanguageSwitcher />`
component so that users can change the language themselves. These docs will cover each in detail.
