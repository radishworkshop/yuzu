title: Initializing Yuzu
description: Setting up your workspace and creating a project
---

The simplest way to install yuzu is with NPM. [NPM recommends](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-packages-globally) simply using the `npx` command as opposed to installing globally, or you can run `npm install -g yuzu` if you prefer. These docs will assume you are using `npx`.

## Initializing the Yuzu project
The first thing you'll want to do is initialize yuzu in your project root. This will create a `yuzu.config.ts` file, as well as a directory for your translations, with a file for your default language.

```bash
npx yuzu init
```

Answer the provided options. The reason Yuzu asks about the web framework you're using
is for code generation purposes. Certain frameworks (e.g. next-international) are fully supported out of the box, meaning Yuzu will automatically generate and update your 
server.ts and client.ts files.

If you would like to see more support, don't hesitate to [request it](/discord)!

```txt
$ Would you like to use TypeScript (recommended)? › no / yes
$ Which web framework are you using? › - Use arrow-keys. Return to submit.
❯    NextJS
-    Astro
-    SvelteKit
-    Other
$ What is your default locale code? › en
$ What is your default locale name? › English
$ What tone would you like to use for translations (formal or informal)?
$ In which folder will your resource files reside (e.g. 'en.json')? › yuzu
$ Write configuration to yuzu.config.[ts|js]. Proceed?
```

This will generate a yuzu config file, as well as the directory for your translations, with a file for your default language.

Finally, the `init` command will open a browser window to the Yuzu dashboard. There you can make a new project and save the API key in your environment file (such as .env or .env.local) as `YUZU_API_KEY=your-key`.

It's not recommended that you edit them directly (see [The Yuzu Method](/docs/the-yuzu-method)). The reason for this is they could be overwritten with a `sync` or `pull`, and this helps reduce errors. Instead, use CLI commands like `sync`, `build`, `push`, `pull`, and `translate` to manage your dictionary and logic.

## Config file format
The commented example config file below illustrates the format that will be created
when you run `yuzu init`. You can also edit the file directly after initial generation.

```ts
export default {
  // List of all the locales as { code: string, name: string } objects.
  locales: [{
    code: 'en',
    name: 'English',
  }],
  // Currently only used for generating the build function
  webFrameworks: 'nextjs',
  i18nFramework: 'next-international',
  // Glob patterns for files searched during `yuzu build`
  content: [
    '**/*.{tsx,ts,jsx,js}'
  ],
  // Functions whose arguments should be extracted during `yuzu build`
  transformers: ['t', 'i18n'],
  // The name of the folder where localization resources live
  resources: 'yuzu',
  // Templates that generate helper files on `yuzu build`
  // Can be a string or a 
  build: (locales: { code: string, name: string }[]) => ([{
    path: 'server.ts',
    template: 'NEXT_INTERNATIONAL_SERVER'
  }, {
    path: 'client.ts',
    template: 'NEXT_INTERNATIONAL_CLIENT'
  }]),
  tsx: true
} as const
