## Open source Software
Yuzu is built on top of so much amazing open source work.
Here is a small subset of the OSS tools we use:
* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) & [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) across the whole stack
* [React](https://react.dev) & [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev) for static pages including [MDX](https://mdxjs.com)
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io) (including for AST parsing), [SWC](https://swc.rs), & [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
* [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) & [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com) components
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Key providers
While mostly built as for profit companies, these tools have also accelerated
our progress:
* [Linear](https://linear.app) issue tracking
* [GitHub](https://github.com) & [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com)
* [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) hosting
* [Clerk](https://www.clerk.com) authentication
